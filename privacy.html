       <h1>Privacy Policy for Pup Pal</h1>
       <p><strong>Effective Date: July 4, 2025</strong></p>

       <p>At Pup Pal, we value your privacy and are committed to protecting your personal information. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and safeguard your data when you use our offline check-in app, Pup Pal ("the App"), designed to help you track precious moments with your dog pal through loving check-ins.</p>

       <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
       <p>The App operates primarily offline, and we minimize data collection to ensure your privacy. We may collect the following information:</p>
       <ul>
           <li><strong>Location Data</strong>: If you enable location-based check-ins (e.g., to record moments at a dog park), the App may access your device's location data. This data is stored locally on your device and is not transmitted to our servers.</li>
           <li><strong>Camera and Photos</strong>: If you choose to attach photos to your check-ins (e.g., pictures of your dog pal), the App may access your device's camera or photo gallery. These photos are stored locally and not shared with us.</li>
           <li><strong>App Usage Data</strong>: We may collect anonymized usage statistics (e.g., frequency of check-ins) to improve the App's functionality. This data does not identify you personally.</li>
       </ul>

       <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
       <p>The information collected is used solely to provide and improve the App's functionality:</p>
       <ul>
           <li><strong>Location Data</strong>: Used to record check-in locations (e.g., parks or places you visit with your dog pal) and enhance your experience by associating moments with specific places.</li>
           <li><strong>Camera and Photos</strong>: Used to allow you to save and view photos of your dog pal within the App.</li>
           <li><strong>Usage Data</strong>: Used to analyze how the App is used and make improvements, ensuring a better experience for you and your dog pal.</li>
       </ul>
       <p>We do not share, sell, or disclose your personal information to third parties, except as required by law.</p>

       <h2>3. Data Storage and Security</h2>
       <p>All data (e.g., check-in records, location data, and photos) is stored locally on your device. We do not store your personal data on our servers. We implement reasonable security measures to protect data stored within the App, but no system is completely secure. Please ensure your device is protected with a passcode or other security measures.</p>

       <h2>4. Your Choices</h2>
       <p>You have control over the data the App accesses:</p>
       <ul>
           <li><strong>Location Permissions</strong>: You can disable location access in your device settings at any time, though this may limit location-based check-in features.</li>
           <li><strong>Camera/Photo Permissions</strong>: You can deny camera or photo access, which will prevent adding photos to check-ins.</li>
           <li><strong>Data Deletion</strong>: Since data is stored locally, uninstalling the App or clearing its data will remove all associated information from your device.</li>
       </ul>

       <h2>5. Children's Privacy</h2>
       <p>The App is not intended for children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you believe we have collected such information, please contact us to have it removed.</p>

       <h2>6. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
       <p>We may update this Privacy Policy to reflect changes in our practices or legal requirements. We will notify you of significant changes via the App or by updating the effective date on this page. Please review this policy periodically.</p>
